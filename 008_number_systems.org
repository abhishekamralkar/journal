Types of Number System

There are various types of the number system in mathematics. The four most common number system types are:

*** Decimal number system (Base- 10)
*** Binary number system (Base- 2)
*** Octal number system (Base-8)
*** Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)

* Decimal Number System or Base 10 Number System

We humans deals in Decimal Systems mostly. Decimal Systems have base 10 because it uses digits from 0-9.

Lets say number `5328` has digit 8 in a units position, digit 2 in tens position, digit 3 in hundreds position
digit 5 in thousands position.


|5  | 3 |2  |8  |
|---+---+---+---+
|thousands |hundreds | tens | units |
|---+---+---+---+
| 5 X 1000 | 3 X 100 | 2 X 10| 8 X 1|


* Binary Format

Base 2 which means we can go 0-1

Lets say we need to conver 25 to decimal system


* Octal Systems

Base is 8. We can go from 0-7

* Hexadecimal Systems

Base is 16. We can go from 0-15
